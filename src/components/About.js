      <p>
        Hi, I am a passionate <strong>Software Developer</strong> who loves building
        applications that solve real-world problems. I enjoy learning new technologies
        and applying them to create efficient and scalable solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        My main strengths are <strong>problem-solving</strong>, simplifying complex
        concepts, and thinking about the long-term impact of the solutions I create.
        I am always eager to explore new frameworks, tools, and techniques that
        help me become a better developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apart from coding, I also like to share knowledge and explain concepts to
        others in a simple way. I believe in teamwork, continuous improvement, and
        writing clean, maintainable code.
      </p>
